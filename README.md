JavaFXPuzzle
============

JavaFX-Puzzle is a simple JavaFX application which moves rectangles on a game board.

The goal of the game is to move the tiles on the left side in the same positions as the tiles on the right side. One field is empty so a mouse click on an adjacent field moves the tile on the empty position. Every move increases a counter.
